# Web Security Workshop Resources
This repository contains a suite of vulnerable applications for ethical hacking and penetration testing training purposes.  
Each folder contains a single application with multiple exploitable vulnerabilities to practice with in a controlled local lab environment.

**These applications contain critical security vulnerabilities, DO NOT deploy or run these applications outside of your localhost (or expose your localhost while running these)**

## Contents
There are currently 17 exploitable vulnerabilities included within this project, on top of which DVWA offers 3 different difficulty levels for its 13 vulnerabilities.  

## Requirements
* Docker
* Docker Compose
* ~10GB of free disk space

## Recommendations
Majority of the recommended tools for these exercises are already included in a penetration testing focused Linux distribution called Kali Linux. Therefore using Kali minimises the amount of new tools required to complete these exercises successfully.
